# Changelog

Changes to `@uberblick/wireframe` a package user can notice. Throughout 0.x the
format, the vocabulary and the rendering may change in any minor version.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0

The first release: Format v0.1, enough to sketch a confirmation dialog and a page
banner in a ```` ```wireframe ```` block of an Uberblick document.

- `parseWireframe(source)` parses a block's body into a tree of nodes and
  line-numbered warnings and errors. A block over the limits (64,000
  characters, 200 lines, 8 levels of nesting) gets an error and never renders.
- `renderWireframe(result)` draws a result as static, inert DOM under one
  `.wf-root` element. It returns `null` for a result with an error, so the host
  can keep its last good render.
- `summarizeWireframe(result)` gives one line of plain text for the host's
  accessible label.
- `getEmbedStyles()` returns the scoped stylesheet, which also ships as
  `@uberblick/wireframe/styles.css`. Its colours, strokes, radii and type sizes
  come from `--wf-*` custom properties, with light and dark defaults that follow
  the inherited `color-scheme`.
- The vocabulary: `dialog` and `banner` (`.neutral`, `.info`, `.warning`,
  `.danger`) at the top level, holding `text` (`.muted`, `.strong`), `row`
  (`.end`) with `button` (`.primary`, `.danger`, `.link`, `.focus`), and `icon`
  (`archive`).
- An ES module with type declarations and no runtime dependencies, published
  from CI with npm provenance.
